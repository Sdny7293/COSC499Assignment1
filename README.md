# COSC499Assignment1
Small exercise for COSC 499

The **findMax** method takes in an array and using a for loop, loops through the array comparing each element one at a time, starting with the element at index 0. Whenever an element is larger in value than the current number stored in the *max* variable, which was initially the value at index 0 of the array, the new larger value will replace the current value in the *max* variable. It continues so until the end of the array, until which the value in the *max* variable is printed as the maximum value of the array.

The **cube** method takes a number and multiplies by itself three times, in which the cubic of the number is given.
